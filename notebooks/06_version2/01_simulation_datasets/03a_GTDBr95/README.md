Creating simulated test datasets from reference genomes belonging to taxonomic groups not used for initial training/testing of DeepMAsED v2. These new reference genomes are those that are new to the GTDBr95 (versus GTDBr89 used for the initial ref genome selection).

The taxonomic novelty of the new genomes varies from novel genera to novel orders.
