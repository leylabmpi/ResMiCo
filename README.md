# Main Description

The tool is divided into two main parts:

* **DeepMAsED-SM**
  * A snakemake pipeline for:
    * generating DeepMAsED train/test datasets from reference genomes
    * creating feature tables from "real" assemblies (fasta + bam files)
* **DeepMAsED (DL)**
  * A python package for misassembly detection via deep learning


# Setup

## conda 

* [If needed] Install miniconda (or anaconda)
* See the `conda create` line in the .travis.yaml file.
* If just using DeepMAsED-SM:
  * `conda create -n snakemake conda-forge::pandas bioconda::snakemake`

### Testing the DeepMAsED package (optional)

`pytest -s`

### Installing the DeepMAsED package into the conda environment

`python setup.py install`


# Usage

## DeepMAsED-SM

### Creating feature tables for genomes (MAGs)

Feature tables are fed to DeepMAsED (DL) for misassembly classification.

**Input:**

* A table of reference genomes & metagenome samples
  * The table maps reference genomes to metagenomes from which they originate.
    * If MAGs created by binning, you can either combine metagenome samples, or map genomes to many metagenome samples 
  * Table format: `<Taxon>\t<Fasta>\t<Sample>\t<Read1>\t<Read2>`
     * "Taxon" = the species/strain name of the genome
     * "Fasta" = the genome (MAG) fasta file (uncompressed or gzip'ed)
     * "Sample" = the metagenome sample from which the genome originated
       * Note: the 'sample' can just be gDNA from a cultured isolate (not a metagenome)
     * "Read1" = Illumina Read1 for the sample
     * "Read2" = Illumina Read2 for the sample
* The snakemake config file (e.g., `config.yaml`). This includes:
  * Config params on MG communities
  * Config params on assemblers & parameters
  * Note: the same config is used for simulations and feature table creation

### Running locally 

`snakemake --use-conda -j <NUMBER_OF_THREADS> --configfile <MY_CONFIG.yaml_FILE>`

### Running on a cluster

You will need to setup a snakemake profile specific to your cluster setup.
See the following for how:

* [Ley Lab snakemake profiles](https://github.com/leylabmpi/snakemake_profiles)
* [Snakemake docs on cluster config](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/configuration.html)
* [Official snakemake profiles](https://github.com/Snakemake-Profiles)

Note that the job submission script should include the following resources:

* `time` = max job time in minutes
* `n` = number of threads requested
* `mem_gb_pt` = per-thread mem in gigabytes

#### Running on SGE cluster

The SGE profile in [Ley Lab snakemake profiles](https://github.com/leylabmpi/snakemake_profiles)
should work without any modifications (read the README).

You can use `./snakemake_sge.sh` for convenience

### Output

### Creating custom train/test data from reference genomes

This is useful for training DeepMAsED (DL) with a custom
train/test dataset (e.g., just biome-specific taxa). 

**Input:**

* A table listing refernce genomes. Two possible formats:
  * Genome-accession: `<Taxon>\t<Accession>`
     * "Taxon" = the species/strain name
     * "Accession" = the NCBI genbank genome accession 
     * The genomes will be downloaded based on the accession
  * Genome-fasta: `<Taxon>\t<Fasta>`
     * "Taxon" = the species/strain name of the genome
     * "Fasta" = the fasta of the genome sequence
     * Use this option if you already have the genome fasta files (uncompressed or gzip'ed)
* The snakemake config file (e.g., `config.yaml`). This includes:
  * Config params on MG communities
  * Config params on assemblers & parameters

Note: the column order for the tables doesn't matter, but the column names must be exact.

#### Output

The output will the be same as for feature generation, but with extra directories:

* `./output/genomes/`
  * Reference genomes
* `./output/MGSIM/`
  * Simulated metagenomes
* `./output/assembly/`
  * Metagenome assemblies
* `./output/true_errors/`
  * Metagenome assembly errors determined by using the references


## DeepMAsED (DL)

Main interface: `DeepMAsED -h`

Note: `DeepMAsED` can be run without GPUs, but it will be much slower.

### Predicting with existing model

See `DeepMAsED predict -h` 

### Training a new model
